		<p class="description">Design for Experienceâ€™s goal is to help others master their field. 
		   So one extra criterion for judging the awards will be how well the practices employed 
		   by the entrants can teach other practitioners and help them become better at their work.
		   The successful entries will be those that not only demonstrate exemplary practice, 
		   but that are also examples of innovative and remarkable processes that can be learned from.</p>
