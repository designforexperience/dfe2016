		<div class="introText">
			<p>We’ve designed the application process to be very easy to complete by limiting the number of questions we ask upfront and eliminating any requirement that you prepare labor-intensive media supplements to your application. You don't need to have been previously recommended or nominated to apply.</p>
	
			<p><a href="javascript:openAppForm()">if you're ready to fill out an application, you can get started here</a>. If you're considering applying for a Design for Experience award, unsure of which categories to apply for, or have questions about the application process, <a href="#" class="open-intent-form">please let us know</a> and we'll assign someone to help you personally. And check out our <a href="#" class="open-downloads-form">downloads area for a collection of documents</a> that will help you prepare your application.</p>

		<p>There are <a class="curtain-link" href="#categories">20 categories</a> in this year’s Design for Experience awards program, and submissions are welcome from any company, institution, team, group, or individual that’s doing exceptional work in experience-related fields. If you’re not sure which category is the best fit for you, <a href="#" class="open-intent-form">just let us know</a> and a DfE representative will follow up with you to discuss the possibilities.</p>
			
		<p>As you’re preparing your application, remember that in accordance with <a class="curtain-link" href="#categories">the philosophy of the awards program</a>, one of the most important criteria for judging will be how well your example can teach other UX professionals and help them become better at their work.</p>
		
		<h3>Dates and Fees</h3>
		
		<p>This year's program is a retrospective on the best of UX in 2014, so the application window opened on November 21st and the <strong>last day to apply is February 28th</strong>. We will be evaluating applications continuously during the application window and beyond, and if our judges have any questions we will contact you to ask follow-up questions until <strong>winners are announced on March 25th</strong>.</p>

		<p>In last year's program, nearly all of the applications came in within a couple days of the deadline, and we were compelled to extend the deadline to accomodate a large number of late applicants. We're hoping to avoid doing that again to ensure our judging process is smooth and on-schedule, so we've created a <strong>tiered application fee structure</strong> to provide an incentive to apply ahead of the final deadline. The <strong>base application fee is $245</strong>, and the fee increases according to this schedule:</p>
		
		<ul class="feeschedule">
			<li><strong>On or before January 3rd:</strong> $245</li>
			<li><strong>On or before January 24th:</strong> $325</li>
			<li><strong>On or before February 14th:</strong> $405</li>
			<li><strong>On or before Februrary 28th:</strong> $490</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>Application fees are charged to your credit card when the application is completed and submitted. If you're planning to apply or have an application in the works, make sure you've let us know so we can help you meet a deadline and consider any mitigating factors. We're also pleased to offer discounts to students, non-profits, and others who have a compelling case for special considerations; <a href="#" class="open-intent-form">contact us for more information and assistance</a>.</p>
		
		<p>The application fees from the DfE awards program go first to fund the program itself, which requires considerable staff, engineering, infrastructure, and other expenses. The remainder will fund DfE's activities in 2015, most notably continuing to operate <a href="http://uxmag.com" target="_blank">UX Magazine</a> as a free community resource, but also includes a number of initiatives aimed at improving educational opportunities in the UX field, supporting local communities of professionals, bridging the gap between academic research and the practitioner community, and a number of other initiatives that are in the works. Follow Design for Experience <a href="https://twitter.com/dfexp" target="_blank">on Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dfexp" target="_blank">'like' us on Facebook</a>, or <a href="http://eepurl.com/JxfTr" target="_blank">sign up for email updates</a> to stay connected to DfE's community-focused activities, programs, and initiatives.</p>

		<h3>Submitting an Application</h3>
		
		<p>The application process is done online through <a href="javascript:openAppForm()">a form on this site</a>. You'll need to complete a one-time account registration to access the form, and that will allow you to save partially completed applications and/or submit multiple applications under the same account.</p>
		
		<p>While it is possible to create your application entirely in the form, we recommend that you prepare your answers separately in a document you can easily edit and save, and then paste your answers into the form when you’re ready. To help facilitate the process of applying for a Design for Experience award, we’ve created <a href="#" class="open-downloads-form">Word document downloads</a> for each category that contain the category description and all of the application questions. The documents are editable so you can use them to prepare your application question responses before pasting them into the actual application form. <a href="#" class="open-downloads-form">Visit our Downloads area to find these useful documents</a>.</p>

		<h4>Multiple Applications</h4>

		<p>We welcome you to submit as many applications as you’d like. Each application is for one project, product, service, company, organization, etc. in one category. You can submit the same thing for multiple categories and/or submit multiple things for the same category, but each will be a separate application.</p>
		
		<h4>Responding to Questions</h4>
		
		<p>You are free to decide how long to make your responses to the questions on the application&mdash;<strong>there are no word limits or minimums</strong>&mdash;and all of the questions are optional. The application questions are designed to be simple and open-ended, allowing you to respond however you see fit.</p>
		
		<p>As well, we invite you to provide whatever information and materials you already have readily available instead of creating new content for the application. You are of course welcome to specially tailor your responses to this award application, but write-ups and materials prepared for other purposes are perfectly acceptable if they can help us understand the important aspects of your product, project, service, solution, team, etc.</p>
		
		<p>Think of this application as a means of introducing us to your product, service, company, team, etc., and as the beginning of a conversation. If your application passes initial screening and the judges indicate they're interested in learning more, the DfE representative assigned to you will work with you to add greater detail to your application to improve its chances of reaching the final round.</p>
		
		<h4>Supporting Files and Media</h4>
		
		<p><strong>You are not required to submit videos, presentations, images, or other media to accompany your application.</strong> Nevertheless, it will often be helpful for you to provide screenshots, images, deliverables, case studies, documents, and other such supporting materials to support your application. The award application form includes a place where you can provide web addresses for any files that you’d like to have accompany your application. We understand that often these materials are not meant for public dissemination, so they will be accessible only by DfE staff and the judges unless you give us explicit permission to use them in a UX Magazine article or on the awards showcase site.</p>

		<p>Because of file size and storage capacity limitations, we are unable to accept uploads directly from the application form. Instead, we ask that you upload materials to your company’s web server or to a file sharing service such as Dropbox, Box, Google Drive, or other similar services. If you need to assign access privileges to a specific email address, please use awardapps@designforexperience.com. You can list up to 25 links on the award application, and you can also package multiple files into a ZIP file.</p>
		
		<h3>Application Contents</h3>
		
		<p>The application consists of <a href="javascript:openAppForm()">a simple, one-page, web-based form</a> that's divided into three brief sections:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Applicant Information:</strong> the name of the entity or individual submitting the application, and contact info for the person responsible for the application.</li>
			<li><strong>Application Information:</strong> two questions to help us understand how to handle your application. This is where you’ll indicate which category you’re applying for, but if you're uncertain which category is the best fit for you, just choose the <em>"Unsure / Help Me Decide"</em> option. You'll still be able to complete the application, and a DfE representative will follow up with you to help you decide which categories are the best fit.</li>
			<li><strong>Questions:</strong> three general questions about the company, product, service, organization, team, etc., that’s the subject of the application.</li>
		</ol>
		
		<p>After completing this page, you’ll proceed to the payment page, and then the application will be submitted.</p>
	
		<h3>List of Categories and Their Questions</h3>
		<p>Below is a list of each of the 20 categories. <strong>Click on a category name to view a description of the category and its application questions</strong>. We ask roughly the same three questions for each category (although the wording of the questions is slightly different to fit the category) to try to make it very easy to apply for as many categories as fit for you. As a reminder, you are free to decide how long to make your responses to the questions&mdash;there are no word limits or minimums&mdash;and all of the questions are optional. The application questions are designed to be simple and open-ended, allowing you to respond however you see fit.</p>

		<h3>Academic Program</h3>
		<div class="accorSubContainer">
			<p class="aboveAccor">For as vast and influential as experience design has become, there are too few academic programs that provide a direct onramp into experience-oriented professions. This award recognizes academic programs in both traditional and nontraditional settings that do the best job of preparing students with the right information, skills, soft skills, and experience to contribute valuably to experience-driven projects.</p>
			
			<div class="applyAccorPanel accorSub" id="accCat1">
				<h3 class="disabled">1. Please tell us about your academic program generally and help us understand what makes it noteworthy or exceptional.</h3>
				<div></div>

		</div>
		
		<h3>Accessibility</h3>
		<div class="accorSubContainer">
			<p class="aboveAccor">In a fundamental way, making technological experiences accessible to people with physical and sensory impairments and those with needs for special modes of interaction represents the true heart of experience design. However, accessibility remains under-adopted as a hard-and-fast requirement for products and services, and fragmentation threatens progress toward universality of accessible experiences. This award recognizes companies, teams, individuals, products, and services that are shining examples of how accessibility can be embraced and explored using new technology to create experiential value for users.</p>
			
			<div class="applyAccorPanel accorSub" id="accCat2">
				<h3 class="disabled">1. Please tell us about how you focused on accessibility and/or how you improved the successfulness of a product, service, experience, etc., through attention to accessibility.</h3>

		<h3>Advanced Experience Ecosystem</h3>
		<div class="accorSubContainer">
			<p class="aboveAccor">At the same time that wearable technology seems to have finally found its footing, sensors are now small enough to be embedded in just about anything, creating the opportunity to design experience ecosystems where mobile devices, pieces of wearable technology, and previously quiet products and appliances are able to communicate freely. This award recognizes compelling examples of products and experiences designed to seize this potential.</p>

			<div class="applyAccorPanel accorSub" id="accCat3">
				<h3 class="disabled">1. Please tell us about how you created a product or service that plays a key part in the establishment of an elegant experience ecosystem or how you’ve used connected devices to create such an ecosystem.</h3>
				<div></div>
				<h3 class="disabled">2. Where should we look for more information about your product or service and/or the elegant ecosystem you’ve created or become a part of? If a username/password, special instructions, a serial number, or anything else is required for us to be able to access something, please also provide that here.</h3>

		<h3>Bringing Big Data to Life</h3>
		<div class="accorSubContainer">
			<p class="aboveAccor">The rate at which data is created and collected never ceases to increase, and buried in these mountains of data is a treasure trove of potential for giving users a fully realized sense of their past and present, while helping them determine their own futures. Unlocking the value of “big data,” requires new ways of connecting, interpreting, and visualizing massive data sets. This award recognizes compelling examples of how the design of digital visualizations, interfaces, interaction models, and other user experience solutions can advance our understanding of complex questions and concepts.</p>
			
			<div class="applyAccorPanel accorSub" id="accCat4">
				<h3 class="disabled">1. Please tell us how you were able to bring big data to life and what effects your solution had, helping us understand what makes this solution noteworthy or exceptional.</h3>
				<div></div>
				<h3 class="disabled">2. Where should we look for more information about how you brought big data to life and, where applicable, any related products, services, experiences, etc.? If a username/password, special instructions, a serial number, or anything else is required for us to be able to access something, please also provide that here.</h3>

		<h3>Building Trust</h3>
		<div class="accorSubContainer">
			<p class="aboveAccor">To quote a recent UX Magazine article, “Simply put, trust is the ‘good’ in good experience design.” If users trust a product or service, they are significantly more likely to use it again and again. It’s easy to talk about trust in design, but it’s quite another thing to actually implement it into your process. This award recognizes products, services, teams, and organizations that have found ways to put trust into their designs in a way that resonates with users.</p>
			
			<div class="applyAccorPanel accorSub" id="accCat5">
				<h3 class="disabled">Please tell us what you did to create an experience that gave users trust in your product or service, and help us understand what makes your approach to building trust noteworthy or exceptional.</h3>
				<div></div>
				<h3 class="disabled">2. Where should we look for more information about how you created a product, service, or experience that instilled a sense of trust in your users? If a username/password, special instructions, a serial number, or anything else is required for us to be able to access something, please also provide that here.</h3>

		<h3>Championing User Interests</h3>
		<div class="accorSubContainer">
			<p class="aboveAccor">While designing a product, service, or other experience, project team members have to make decisions with the best interests of users in mind. Very few of these decisions can be made in consultation with actual users, so it falls to the team to attempt to see the world from the users’ point of view and make informed decisions on their behalf. This award recognizes companies, project/product groups, and other groups that promote a well-informed empathy for users among team members, fostering greater success in their work.</p>
			
			<div class="applyAccorPanel accorSub" id="accCat6">
				<h3 class="disabled">1. Please tell us about how you promoted empathy for users and/or how you improved the successfulness of a product, service, experience, etc., through attention to user empathy.</h3>
				<div></div>
				<h3 class="disabled">2. Where should we look for more information about your promotion of empathy for users and any related products, services, experiences, etc.? If a username/password, special instructions, a serial number, or anything else is required for us to be able to access something, please also provide that here.</h3>

		<h3>Complete Customer Experience</h3>
		<div class="accorSubContainer">
			<p class="aboveAccor">Companies with successful customer experience (CX) strategies deliver a cohesive, comprehensible, and unified experience that allows users to interact with the company through a well-coordinated ecosystem of products and touchpoints. As technology keeps adding sophistication and depth to these interactions, companies have to mold experiences that are unified and robust in order to remain hecustomer experience that maintains a sense of brand, delivers value, and is easy to navigate.</p>
			
			<div class="applyAccorPanel accorSub" id="accCat7">

		<h3>Consumer Product</h3>
		<div class="accorSubContainer">
			<p class="aboveAccor">More and more consumer products are being designed with user needs and usability in mind, which is indicative of the growing awareness and interest in the practices of user-centered design. This award recognizes consumer products that create or enable excellent experiences for their users, and demonstrate design that was strongly influenced by user-centered research and design practices.</p>
			
			<div class="applyAccorPanel accorSub" id="accCat8">
				<h3 class="disabled">1. Please tell us about your consumer product, and help us understand what makes your product noteworthy or exceptional.</h3>

		<h3>Disruptive Experience</h3>
		<div class="accorSubContainer">
			<p class="aboveAccor">While the term “disruptive” is frequently overused, truly disruptive products and services are the benchmarks we design against. Whenever practitioners are able to find the potential for experiences that can change our relationships with technology in fundamental ways, they can send ripples of inspiration across our industry. The award recognizes truly disruptive experiences with the power to change the way we look at design, both as practitioners and as users.</p>

		<h3>Enterprise or Business Solution</h3>
		<div class="accorSubContainer">
			<p class="aboveAccor">Historically, usability hasn’t been a priority for business and enterprise software. As users have become critical of the finely tuned experiences consumer products offer, however, the bar has been raised on workforce solutions. Unwieldy, confusing applications are no longer acceptable, and this award recognizes enterprise and business solutions that put a premium on user needs while also meeting key business requirements.</p>

There's also a certain uniformity to the tools available to experience designers, such as those used to create wireframes and prototypes. Here, too, there’s room for improvement and innovation.
