					<h3>Academic Program</h3>
					<p>For as vast and influential as experience design has become, there are too few academic programs that provide a direct onramp into experience-oriented professions. This award recognizes academic programs in both traditional and nontraditional settings that do the best job of preparing students with the right information, skills, soft skills, and experience to contribute valuably to experience-driven projects.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Accessibility</h3>
					<p>In a fundamental way, making technological experiences accessible to people with physical and sensory impairments and those with needs for special modes of interaction represents the true heart of experience design. However, accessibility remains under-adopted as a hard-and-fast requirement for products and services, and fragmentation threatens progress toward universality of accessible experiences. This award recognizes companies, teams, individuals, products, and services that are shining examples of how accessibility can be embraced and explored using new technology to create experiential value for users.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Advanced Experience Ecosystem</h3>
					<p>At the same time that wearable technology seems to have finally found its footing, sensors are now small enough to be embedded in just about anything, creating the opportunity to design experience ecosystems where mobile devices, pieces of wearable technology, and previously quiet products and appliances are able to communicate freely. This award recognizes compelling examples of products and experiences designed to seize this potential.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Bringing Big Data to Life</h3>
					<p>The rate at which data is created and collected never ceases to increase, and buried in these mountains of data is a treasure trove of potential for giving users a fully realized sense of their past and present, while helping them determine their own futures. Unlocking the value of “big data,” requires new ways of connecting, interpreting, and visualizing massive data sets. This award recognizes compelling examples of how the design of digital visualizations, interfaces, interaction models, and other user experience solutions can advance our understanding of complex questions and concepts.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Building Trust</h3>
					<p>To quote a recent UX Magazine article, "Simply put, trust is the 'good' in good experience design." If users trust a product or service, they are significantly more likely to use it again and again. It’s easy to talk about trust in design, but it’s quite another thing to actually implement it into your process. This award recognizes products, services, teams, and organizations that have found ways to put trust into their designs in a way that resonates with users.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Championing User Interests</h3>
					<p>While designing a product, service, or other experience, project team members have to make decisions with the best interests of users in mind. Very few of these decisions can be made in consultation with actual users, so it falls to the team to attempt to see the world from the users’ point of view and make informed decisions on their behalf. This award recognizes companies, project/product groups, and other groups that promote a well-informed empathy for users among team members, fostering greater success in their work.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Complete Customer Experience</h3>
					<p>Companies with successful customer experience (CX) strategies deliver a cohesive, comprehensible, and unified experience that allows users to interact with the company through a well-coordinated ecosystem of products and touchpoints. As technology keeps adding sophistication and depth to these interactions, companies have to mold experiences that are unified and robust in order to remain competitive. This award recognizes companies offering a consistent, cohesive customer experience that maintains a sense of brand, delivers value, and is easy to navigate.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Consumer Product</h3>
					<p>More and more consumer products are being designed with user needs and usability in mind, which is indicative of the growing awareness and interest in the practices of user-centered design. This award recognizes consumer products that create or enable excellent experiences for their users, and demonstrate design that was strongly influenced by user-centered research and design practices.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Digital Media and Entertainment</h3>
					<p>The way we consume media has changed dramatically over the past three decades. Whether it’s news, entertainment, or games, users are engaged with media in completely new ways that hinge on the influence of design and technology. Successful digital media experiences give users new and rewarding ways to connect with the things they value, whether it’s the show they want to watch, a delightful moment in a game, or timely and relevant information. The award recognizes experiences across all types of media that have improved how people discover, access, and engage with digital media.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Disruptive Experience</h3>
					<p>While the term “disruptive” is frequently overused, truly disruptive products and services are the benchmarks we design against. Whenever practitioners are able to find the potential for experiences that can change our relationships with technology in fundamental ways, they can send ripples of inspiration across our industry. The award recognizes truly disruptive experiences with the power to change the way we look at design, both as practitioners and as users.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Effective Agency Team</h3>
					<p>Great experiences originate the minds and combined efforts of effective experience-oriented teams. Investing in the design and creation of an experience-driven product or service requires an effective team to reduce risk and improve upside potential. This award recognizes experience-oriented product teams, UX business units, project groups, or any other kind of agency team that consistently designs or creates effective or exemplary digital experiences.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Effective In-House Team</h3>
					<p>Great experiences originate the minds and combined efforts of effective experience-oriented teams. Investing in the design and creation of an experience-driven product or service requires an effective team to reduce risk and improve upside potential. This award recognizes experience-oriented product teams, UX business units, project groups, or any other kind of in-house team that consistently designs or creates effective or exemplary digital experiences.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Enterprise or Business Solution</h3>
					<p>Historically, usability hasn’t been a priority for business and enterprise software. As users have become critical of the finely tuned experiences consumer products offer, however, the bar has been raised on workforce solutions. Unwieldy, confusing applications are no longer acceptable, and this award recognizes enterprise and business solutions that put a premium on user needs while also meeting key business requirements.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Experience for Children</h3>
					<p>Children can be sophisticated users of technology, and with newer methods of interaction such as touch and gestures, digital systems are accessible to an even younger set of potential users. Every age bracket of children has different specific needs for content, navigation, interactions, and other aspects of product experiences. This award recognizes digital products for children that deliver excellent value, engagement, and ease of use for their users.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Experience that Makes a Difference</h3>
					<p>Technology has incredible potential to make a positive impact in people’s lives, whether on an individual level or by addressing societal or global concerns. This award recognizes digital products, systems, and other experience design initiatives that contribute meaningful improvements to people’s lives, to society, and/or to the world, where the quality of the product or system’s user experience is essential to its success.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Experience Design Strategy</h3>
					<p>Companies that provide exceptional experiences in their products and services understand that user and customer experience are high-level strategic values, not just low-level tactical practices. This award recognizes companies that have thoroughly and effectively embraced experience design as an overarching strategy, with the success in doing so evident in executive leadership, design and engineering teams, and general staff with the ability to influence user and customer experiences.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Innovative Tool or Technique</h3>
					<p>Although there’s striking consistency in the research and design techniques employed by practitioners and companies, there are still opportunities for existing techniques to be improved upon, or for altogether new ones to be devised. There's also a certain uniformity to the tools available to experience designers, such as those used to create wireframes and prototypes. Here, too, there’s room for improvement and innovation. This award recognizes new or improved research techniques, design techniques, and design tools that affect the quality and success of experience design.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Interactive Advertising or Marketing</h3>
					<p>Nearly every major advertising or marketing campaign has significant online and/or interactive components, but they don’t always reflect the needs of the business and its hopes for how customers might behave. This award recognizes interactive advertising or marketing campaigns that deliver real value, engagement, and/or utility to customers while creatively complementing the other facets of the campaign.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Mobile Solution or Application</h3>
					<p>Mobile devices and mobile-platform computing have literally gone global, leading to an astonishing number of mobile applications and solutions. Many of these are created without sufficient regard to the needs of users and the opportunities inherent to the mobile platforms. This award recognizes mobile applications and solutions that work with unique device capabilities, contexts of use, and modes of use of mobile devices to expose new and valuable experiences to users.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Public Sector Experience</h3>
					<p>A vast litany of factors, budgetary, security, and compliance—routinely make the quality and usefulness of technology systems built for public sector entities lag far behind the private sector. Nevertheless, there are extraordinary opportunities to use user-centered practices to effect positive changes, and this award recognizes digital solutions, applications, services, and other experiences created by or for public-sector entities that deliver real value to citizens.</p>
