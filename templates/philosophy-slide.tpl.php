		<h2>Recognizing mastery<br />
			to advance<br />

			opportunity</h2>
		
		<p class="description">Teaching and learning are at the heart of Design for Experience’s mission and service to the UX community. Through <a href-"http://uxmag.com" target="_blank">UX Magazine</a> and our other programs and initiatives, we’re continuously adding to the base of freely available resources that help practitioners grow their skills and careers, and opening doors for new people entering the field.
			<br /> <br />
			In keeping with that mission, the purpose of the DfE awards isn’t just to recognize excellence for its own sake, but to also <strong>draw valuable lessons from leading examples of mastery in UX</strong> and related fields. This focus on <strong>learning will be central</strong> in the selection of award winners; a key consideration in the judging process will be the strength of what can be learned from the applicant’s example, and how well their work can <strong>advance understanding of best, leading practices in UX</strong>.</p>
